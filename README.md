Let's face it, your computer is a dude, and not just a regular dude, he's a *real bro*.

And that's the thing that humanity failed to realise thus far,
we've been trying to talk to our computer with obscure languages like: JavaScript, Java, C#, Python, Ruby and even C++. Which are bloody strange, and compiled to an even stranger things like asm and eventually to 1's and 0's, which thought to be 'native'.  
But a computer isn't a heartless thing, taking orders from binary seqeunces. So a real, 'native', language was needed.  

Introducing brolang

Finally you can speak to your computer directly.  
For example, ask it to do some sweet fibronacci computation:
```
dude check dat fib. it wants the (d)
  if (d < 3) i would totally
    1
  whatever ill just
    fib(d-1) + fib(d-2);  
```  

#### Current state
Currently it's just a glorified fork of chapter 7 from [Stephen Diehl's](https://github.com/sdiehl) great tutorial on ["Implementing a JIT Compiled Language with Haskell and LLVM"](http://www.stephendiehl.com/llvm/).  
But in due time, the language will beacome a _robust_ and _full-featured_ _kickass(ing)_ tool, which in the right hands, can achieve greatness.

#### TODO
* Translate the entire existing syntax
* Actually read the tutorial
* Introduce more types
* Docs
* Create a dude friendly compiler
* Transform the syntax to a more pythonic one(?)
* Benchmarks
* Add vim + sublime support
* Force JetBrains to support it
* Watch some Fight Club

<sub>While this clearly is a case of a bad joke, experimenting with this kind of syntax has raised some interesting thoughts on developing an 'English' programming language, for educational purposes.</sub><br/>
<sub>As I'll evolve this language, I think we could really see some interesting and clear code snippets</sub>
